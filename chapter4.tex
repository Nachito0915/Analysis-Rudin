\chapter{Continuity}

\begin{exercise}
\item
  Suppose \(f\) is a real function defined on \(\mathbb{R}^1\) which satisfies
  \[
  \lim_{h\to 0}\bigl[f(x + h) - f(x - h)\bigr] = 0
  \]
  for every \(x\in\mathbb{R}^1\).
  Does this imply \(f\) is continuous?
  \par\smallskip
  Consider
  \[
  f(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    1, & x = 0\\
    0, & x\neq 0
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Then \(f\) is continuous at zero if for every \(\epsilon > 0\) there exist a
  \(\delta > 0\) such that \(d_Y\bigl[f(x),f(0)\bigr] < \epsilon\) for all
  \(x\in\mathbb{R}^1\) for which \(0 < d_X(x,0) < \delta\).
  For \(x\neq 0\), \(0 < \lvert x - 0\rvert < \delta\).
  Then \(\lvert f(x) - f(0)\rvert = 1\).
  Take \(\epsilon = 1/2\) so \(\lvert f(x) - f(0)\rvert > \epsilon\) and \(f\)
  is not continuous at \(x = 0\).
  For \(x\neq 0\), \(f(x) = 0\).
  Now for \(h < \lvert x\rvert\), \(x + h\neq 0\neq x - h\); therefore,
  \(f(x + h) = f(x - h) = 0\).
  \[
  \lim_{h\to 0}\bigl[f(x + h) - f(x - h)\bigr] = 0
  \]
  For \(x = 0\) and \(h > 0\), \(f(x + h) = f(h) = f(-h) = f(x - h)\) and again
  the limit is zero.
\item
  If \(f\) is a continuous mapping of a metric space \(X\) into a metric space
  \(Y\), prove that
  \[
  f(\bar{E})\subset\overline{f(E)}
  \]
  for every set \(E\subset X\).
  Show, by example, that \(f(\bar{E})\) can be a proper subset of
  \(\overline{f(E)}\).
\item
  Let \(f\) be a continuous real function on a metric space \(X\).
  Let \(Z(f)\) (the zero set of \(f\)) be the set of all \(p\in X\) at which
  \(f(p) = 0\).
  Prove that \(Z(f)\) is closed.
\item
  Let \(f\) and \(g\) be continuous mappings of a metric space \(X\) into a
  metric space \(Y\), and let \(E\) be a dense subset of \(X\).
  Prove that \(f(E)\) is dense in \(f(X)\).
  If \(g(p) = f(p)\) for all \(p\in E\), prove that \(g(p) = f(p)\) for all
  \(p\in X\).
  (In other words, a continuous mapping is determined by its values on a dense
  subset of its domain.)
\item
  If \(f\) is a real continuous function defined on a closed set
  \(E\subset\mathbb{R}^1\), prove that there exist continuous real functions
  \(g\) on \(\mathbb{R}^1\) such that \(g(x) = f(x)\) for all \(x\in E\).
  (Such functions \(g\) are called \textit{continuous extensions} of \(f\) from
  \(E\) to \(\mathbb{R}^1\).)
  Show that the result becomes false if the word "closed" is omitted.
  Extend the result to vector valued functions.
  \textit{Hint: let the graph of \(g\) be a straight line on each of the
    segments which constitute the complement of \(E\) (compare
    \cref{2.29}~\cref{ch2}).
    The result remains true if \(\mathbb{R}^1\) is replaced by any metric
    space, but the proof is not so simple.}
