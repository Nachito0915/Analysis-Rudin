\chapter{Continuity}

\begin{exercise}
\item
  Suppose \(f\) is a real function defined on \(\mathbb{R}^1\) which satisfies
  \[
  \lim_{h\to 0}\bigl[f(x + h) - f(x - h)\bigr] = 0
  \]
  for every \(x\in\mathbb{R}^1\).
  Does this imply \(f\) is continuous?
  \par\smallskip
  Consider
  \[
  f(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    1, & x = 0\\
    0, & x\neq 0
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Then \(f\) is continuous at zero if for every \(\epsilon > 0\) there exist a
  \(\delta > 0\) such that \(d_Y\bigl[f(x),f(0)\bigr] < \epsilon\) for all
  \(x\in\mathbb{R}^1\) for which \(0 < d_X(x,0) < \delta\).
  For \(x\neq 0\), \(0 < \lvert x - 0\rvert < \delta\).
  Then \(\lvert f(x) - f(0)\rvert = 1\).
  Take \(\epsilon = 1/2\) so \(\lvert f(x) - f(0)\rvert > \epsilon\) and \(f\)
  is not continuous at \(x = 0\).
  For \(x\neq 0\), \(f(x) = 0\).
  Now for \(h < \lvert x\rvert\), \(x + h\neq 0\neq x - h\); therefore,
  \(f(x + h) = f(x - h) = 0\).
  \[
  \lim_{h\to 0}\bigl[f(x + h) - f(x - h)\bigr] = 0
  \]
  For \(x = 0\) and \(h > 0\), \(f(x + h) = f(h) = f(-h) = f(x - h)\) and again
  the limit is zero.
\item
  If \(f\) is a continuous mapping of a metric space \(X\) into a metric space
  \(Y\), prove that
  \[
  f(\bar{E})\subset\overline{f(E)}
  \]
  for every set \(E\subset X\).
  Show, by example, that \(f(\bar{E})\) can be a proper subset of
  \(\overline{f(E)}\).
  \par\smallskip
  Let \(E\subset X\) and \(x\in\bar{E}\).
  Let \(V\) be an open neighborhood of \(f(x)\).
  Since \(f\) is continuous, \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open set of \(X\) where
  \(x\in f^{-1}(V)\).
  Therefore, \(f^{-1}(V)\) intersects \(E\).
  Let \(y\in f^{-1}(V)\cap E\).
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    f[f^{-1}(v)\cap E] & = f[f^{-1}(V)]\cap f(E)\\
                       & = V\cap f(E)
  \end{align*}
  so \(f(y)\in V\cap f(E)\).
  Therefore, \(f(y)\) exist in a neighborhood of \(f(x)\) so \(f(x)\) is an
  adherent point so \(f(x)\in\overline{f(E)}\).
  Thus, \(f(\bar{E})\subset\overline{f(E)}\).
\item
  Let \(f\) be a continuous real function on a metric space \(X\).
  Let \(Z(f)\) (the zero set of \(f\)) be the set of all \(p\in X\) at which
  \(f(p) = 0\).
  Prove that \(Z(f)\) is closed.
  \par\smallskip
  Let \(E\) be the set that contains \(f(p) = 0\).
  The only element in \(E\) is \(0\) so \(E\) is closed.
  Since \(f\) is continuous, \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\) map closed sets to closed
  sets.
  Thus, \(f^{-1}(E)\subset X\) and is closed in \(X\).
  Now, \(f^{-1}(E)\) are all the points \(p\in X\) such that \(f(p) = 0\) so
  \(f^{-1}(E) = Z(f)\) and \(Z(f)\) is closed.
\item
  Let \(f\) and \(g\) be continuous mappings of a metric space \(X\) into a
  metric space \(Y\), and let \(E\) be a dense subset of \(X\).
  Prove that \(f(E)\) is dense in \(f(X)\).
  If \(g(p) = f(p)\) for all \(p\in E\), prove that \(g(p) = f(p)\) for all
  \(p\in X\).
  (In other words, a continuous mapping is determined by its values on a dense
  subset of its domain.)
\item
  If \(f\) is a real continuous function defined on a closed set
  \(E\subset\mathbb{R}^1\), prove that there exist continuous real functions
  \(g\) on \(\mathbb{R}^1\) such that \(g(x) = f(x)\) for all \(x\in E\).
  (Such functions \(g\) are called \textit{continuous extensions} of \(f\) from
  \(E\) to \(\mathbb{R}^1\).)
  Show that the result becomes false if the word "closed" is omitted.
  Extend the result to vector valued functions.
  \textit{Hint: let the graph of \(g\) be a straight line on each of the
    segments which constitute the complement of \(E\) (compare
    \cref{2.29}~\cref{ch2}).
    The result remains true if \(\mathbb{R}^1\) is replaced by any metric
    space, but the proof is not so simple.}
\item
  If \(f\) is defined on \(E\), the \textit{graph} of \(f\) is the set of
  points \((x,f(x)\), for \(x\in E\).
  In particular, if \(E\) is a set of real numbers, and \(f\) is real-valued,
  the graph of \(f\) is a subset of the plane.
  Suppose \(E\) is compact, and prove that \(f\) is continuous on \(E\) if and
  only if its graph is compact.
\item
  If \(E\subset X\) and if \(f\) is a function defined on \(X\), the
  \textit{restriction} of \(f\) to \(E\) is the function \(g\) whose domain of
  definition is \(E\), such that \(g(p) = f(p)\) for \(p\in E\).
  Define \(f\) and \(g\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) by: \(f(0,0) = g(0,0) = 0\),
  \(f(x,y) = xy^2/(x^2 + y^4)\), \(g(x,y) = xy^2/(x^2 + y^6)\) if
  \((x,y)\neq 0\).
  Prove that \(f\) is bounded on \(\mathbb{R}^2\), that \(g\) is unbounded in
  every neighborhood of \((0,0)\), and that \(f\) is not continuous at
  \((0,0)\); nevertheless, the restrictions of both \(f\) and \(g\) to every
  straight line in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) are continuous!
\item
  Let \(f\) be a real uniformly continuous function on the bounded set \(E\) in
  \(\mathbb{R}^1\).
  Prove that \(f\) is bounded on \(E\).
  Show that the conclusion is false if boundedness of \(E\) is omitted from the
  hypothesis.
\item
  Show that the requirement in the definition of uniform continuity can be
  rephrased as follows, in terms of diameters of sets: To every
  \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that
